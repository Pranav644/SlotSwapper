# SlotSwapper:
This project is a full-stack web application for managing personal calendars and facilitating event time swaps between users. The backend is built with Express.js, Prisma ORM, and SQLite, providing RESTful APIs for user authentication, event management, and swap requests. Users can sign up, log in, and create calendar events, each with a status indicating its availability for swapping. The frontend, developed in React, enables users to view their calendar, mark events as swappable, browse other users’ available time slots in a marketplace, and propose swaps. Swap requests can be accepted or rejected, and upon successful swap, the event ownership is exchanged and both slots are marked busy. JWT-based authentication secures all protected backend routes, ensuring users interact only with their own data. The application offers a seamless experience for managing schedules and negotiating swaps, making collaborative time management efficient and user-friendly.
